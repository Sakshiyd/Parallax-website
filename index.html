          An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving,para-gliding, mountain climbing, surfing, river rafting,biking or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.

          Adventure is an activity that involves thrill, excitement and a risk factor. Several sports like horse riding, bungee jumping, river rafting, parasailing, paragliding, skiing, and kayaking are some of the most popular adventure activities also referred to as ‘adventure sports’.

          <h2 class="description">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
          <p class="text">
            Going on a bike tour can be as simple as a taking a weekend trip close to where you live or as grand as setting off on a months-long international adventure that covers thousands of miles
When deciding where to go, consider how much time you have, how many miles you want to ride and what you’d like to see along the way. By looking closely at maps and doing online research, you’ll be able to piece together a route that takes you where you want to go.
            <br />
            <br />
            There’s no one right type of bike for touring, so if you have a road or mountain bike at home that’s in decent working order, you can likely set out on a tour without investing in a new ride. Changes can be made to most bikes to make them better suited for touring, such as changing the gearing to give you really easy gears for going uphill, putting on wider tires to increase comfort, and adding front and rear racks so you can carry panniers.

          <h2 class="description">PARA-GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
          <p class="text">
            Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

            paragliding, sport of flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their gliding capabilities. Unlike hang gliders, their close relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy acts as a wing and is constructed of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be inflated by movement through the air—the “ram-air” effect.

          <h2 class="description">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
          <p class="text">
            Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.

            <br />
            Surfing is a kind of water sports where the surfer is carried along by a breaking wave towards the shore. Apart from surfboards body boards, kneeboards, surf skis and kayaks can be also used to surf. Various sports involving surfing are sea kayaking, paddle boarding, kite surfing and windsurfing. The first two do not require waves and winds, while the other two does. Surfing has become more of a profession by turning into a multi-billion dollar industry.
